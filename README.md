## Overview

### The Challenge

Build a weather app where users can:

1. Search for weather information by location.
2. View current weather (temperature, weather icon, location).
3. See additional weather metrics: feels like temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation.
4. Browse a 7-day forecast with high/low temperatures.
5. View an hourly forecast for the selected day.
6. Switch between days using the day selector.
7. Toggle between Metric and Imperial units.
8. Have a responsive, mobile-first interface.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for markup
- **CSS3** with Flexbox & Grid
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for dynamic content
- **Fetch API** to get weather data from [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)
- **DOM manipulation** for updating UI dynamically

---

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
```

- Navigate into the project folder:
- cd weather-app
- Open index.html in your browser, or serve via a local server (e.g., Live Server in VSCode).

2. Usage

   - Type a city in the search bar to fetch weather data.
   - Click the day dropdown to view hourly forecasts for that day.
   - Click the unit toggle to switch between Metric and Imperial units.
   - Default city and day load automatically on page load.

3. What I Learned

   - Fetching and handling real-time weather data from an API.
   - Dynamically creating hourly and daily forecast cards.
   - Converting 24-hour time to 12-hour AM/PM format.
   - Managing UI state for unit conversions and day selection.
   - Responsive design and mobile-first development.

4. Future Improvements

   - Modularize code: separate API logic, DOM updates, and event handlers.
   - Add animations when switching days or units.
   - Save user preferences (unit, last searched city) in local storage.
   - Better error handling for API failures or empty results.
